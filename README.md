# BotBase

A shared library for my Discord bots.

[Examples](https://github.com/SquirrelKiev/BotBase) provided are two templates (Barebones and BarebonesWithExtras), and a simple Todo list bot.

Barebones has the bare minimum required to get a bot working with this library (command service, logging), and BarebonesWithExtras also includes components like database handling, a Config command, a customizeable about command, and a help command.
